# ipsemester3_music
Using the Spotify API we can get access to an almost infinite library of music and playlists. This service is designed to make it easier to use and implement in other applications regardless of coding language used.

# research
The Spotify API is a RESTApi use to get data from the Spotify service. We're using this API because Spotify already has a large library of music and millions of users paying for it. With the API we can ask the user to authorize using their own spotify account. This way we have access to the user's information and playlists. 

In order to get the authorization working, we need to verify the app with the spotify developer portal. The verified URL is 127.0.0.1:4000. Any other url will not support Spotify authorization and will therefore not work.

# Setup
Before setting up, make sure the application is hosted on 127.0.0.1:4000. This is required for the Spotify authorization.
