# ipsemester3_music
Using the Spotify API we can get access to an almost infinite library of music and playlists. This service is designed to make it easier to use and implement in other applications regardless of coding language used.

# research
The Spotify API is a RESTApi use to get data from the Spotify service. We're using this API because Spotify already has a large library of music and millions of users paying for it. With the API we can ask the user to authorize using their own spotify account. This way we have access to the user's information and playlists. 

In order to get the authorization working, we need to have a verified application. Because we don't have enough time for that, we'll be mocking user specific data for music playback.
